# Chapter 04

1. Using library functions, define a function `halve :: [ a ] â†’ ([ a ], [ a ])` that splits an even-lengthed list into two halves. For example:
> `halve [1,2,3,4,5,6]` should give  `([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`

```haskell

halve :: [a] -> ([a], [a])
halve xs = (take (length xs `div` 2) xs , drop (length xs `div` 2) xs )

```
